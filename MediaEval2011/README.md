MediaEval 2011 Runs
===================
This folder contains parameter files and the corresponding result files when running version v0.1 (GitHub tag) on the MediaEval 2011 data set.

The results are approximately the same as reported in http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-807/Hauff_WISTUD_Placing_me11wn.pdf (the original working notes paper where parts of the code were first used).

The parameter file settings are contained in the result files, as well as the accuracy overview and the estimated locations for each test item. This is the output the BaselinePrediction program generates.

* `res.baseline` corresponds to the Basic run in Table 2 of the paper.
* `res.geogen` corresponds to the GeoGen run in Table 2 of the paper.
* `res.gen` corresponds to the Gen run in Table 2 of the paper.
